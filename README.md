Backend developer at Tanooco. I have completed the University Technician Program in Programming Technologies at UPSO and am currently pursuing a degree in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology at UNLP. I code in C#/.NET, PHP/Laravel, and Python for data analysis, with experience in C++/Arduino for embedded systems development. My biotechnology background provides a strong foundation in mathematics, which complements my tech skills.

In addition to backend work, I have experience with frontend development, including HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript, and TypeScript/Angular.

Outside of coding, I am an avid astrophotography enthusiast, capturing the beauty of the cosmos.
