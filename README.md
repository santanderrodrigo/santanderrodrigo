Backend developer at Tanooco. I'm also actively pursuing a University Technician Program in Programming Technologies at UPSO and a degree in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology at UNLP. I Code in C#/.NET, PHP/Laravel and Python for data analysis and experienced in Arduino for embedded systems development. My background in biotechnology provides a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, complementing my tech skills.

Beyond backend work, I also have experience in frontend tasks including HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript, TypeScript/Angular

Outside of coding, I'm an avid astrophotography enthusiast, capturing the beauty of the cosmos.
