Backend developer, working with microservices at Tanooco. I'm also actively pursuing a University Technician Program in Programming Technologies at UPSO and a degree in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology at UNLP. Proficient in Python, primarily used for data analysis, and experienced in Arduino for embedded systems development. My background in biotechnology provides a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, complementing my tech skills.

I have knowledge in C++, C#, and .NET, expanding my skill set in software development. Beyond backend work, I also have experience in frontend tasks including HTML, CSS/Tailwind, and Javascript.

Outside of coding, I'm an avid astrophotography enthusiast, capturing the beauty of the cosmos.
